"Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch"
=====================================

transition: rotate

Overview
==================================================
-The data used in the app comes from the Motor Trend Car Road Tests (mtcars) dataset. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). 

*Create a Shiny application

*A Reproducible Pitch Presentation that contains five slides in either Slidify or Rstudio Presenter that is pushed to and hosted on GitHub or Rpubs and contains embedded R code that runs.


introduction
==================================
-"This data product used dataset mtcars to predicts  Miles Per Gallon based on:

*dataset:mtcars

*Input:mpg , Cyl

*Output: Miles Per Gallon by mtcars with histogram

Different mpg help as a tool kit from the dataset mtcars

The application “MPG Prediction Based on Cylinder Size” is deployed here:

Part1: Shiny Application

Part2: slide show presentation

Web Application functionality dataset
====================================================================
This presentation will seek to provide tools for looking at 
cars
To  ensure  efficenty  upload:library
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE}
library(caret)
set.seed(123)
lm1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars)
lm1
summary(mtcars)

```



Slide with Complete Reporting Appliaction
==============================================

```{r , eval=TRUE, message=TRUE}
plot(mtcars$cyl,mtcars$mpg, pch=20,col="orange",main= "MPG Prediction Based on Cylinder Size", xlab="Cylinder size",ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
lines(mtcars$cyl,lm1$fitted, lwd=3)
```
